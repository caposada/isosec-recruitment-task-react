# Follow-up questions
Please either commit your answeers to these questions inline, or submit the answers in an email to the hiring manager.

## 1. How did you find the task?
I really enjoyed it, and now I know that there is a Cocktails API out there!

## 2. Did you feel you had enough time to complete the task in the way you wanted?
Yes, so I thought I would add other features (which I would expect would be standard for such an app).

## 3. If you had more time, what would you improve / add / do differently?
Yes, I would add some of the search parts the API can handle.

## 4. Do you feel that your code is production ready / production quality? If not, what would you do to achieve this?
It is close too production ready, but I would expect anyone in charge of UI to ask for some changes.

## 5. What additional libraries / frameworks / plugins did you use, and why?
None, but I would probably used axios (makes life simpler), typescript (to make is more robust) and bootstrap (to take care of the CSS better than I ever could).
